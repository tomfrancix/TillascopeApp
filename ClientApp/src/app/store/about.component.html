              This can often be the most challenging part to get right. In fact it is the most common reason for Tillandsia fatalities, be it under-watering or overwatering. So you may have the right environment, sufficient light conditions and you are keeping your air plant hydrated with a regular misting… But sometimes this isn’t enough to keep them happy and healthy. Depending on the time of year or the climate in your area, it is normally a good idea to do a little more than misting alone. There are a few ways you can do this.
            </p>

            <p>Dunking: does exactly what is says on the tin! Simply submerge your air plant under water a few times in succession so that the leaves become totally wet. After a few short dunks give your air plant a little shake so as to remove any excess water and then hang them up to dry. Although this process is relatively quick to carry out, some people prefer to keep it even simpler. A practical alternative is to hold your plant under a stream of tap water. The principle here is the same, get those leaves nice and wet so that they can absorb a more sustainable amount of water than that which misting alone provides. This can sometimes be sufficient watering to keep your Tillandsia healthily hydrated - though again this is dependent on numerous factors, such as the species of air plant you are looking after and the frequency of watering.</p>

            <p>Soaking: this is a more effective way of hydrating your air plants as it allows them enough time to properly soak up the water through their silvery hair-like trichomes. We would suggest doing this once every week or two weeks, depending again on the time of year / climate / environment, for between 20 minutes to an hour. Usually in the summertime they will need more water and typically dry faster so leaving them in for a full hour is fairly standard. There are however risks involved in this method, so be weary of them otherwise it could trigger an irreversible reaction that will inevitably kill the air plant… Rot! See below for more details on this and how to prevent it from happening.</p>


            <p>
              Whilst air plants generally can tolerate tap water in many residential areas, they do have a preference. Where possible treat them with filtered rain water. Of course this is not always possible, so the best alternative is to leave some tap water out on the side for 24 hours or so beforehand to allow enough time for the chlorine to dissipate.

            <p>
              Never forget to shake off the excess water, as this is another very common cause of rot! Another good practice is to suspend your air plants upside down when drying off from a soak. This allows the remaining excess water to drain out away from the base, whilst also maximising the air flow to your air plant. They love good air circulation, without it they will have a challenging time showing off their colours to the full extent - something that is maximised when they are in good health. A simple way of doing this is to leave them to dry in a dish rack, so long as there is sufficient space between the plant and the surface beneath them they will drain away the excess water safely.
            </p>
            <p>
              Dry rot: This has less to do with watering and more to do with air circulation. In the absence of proper air circulation air plants will struggle to thrive. This is particularly the case when placed in a closed off terrarium or other vessel. Needless to say this is also a risk factor for wet rot as well, misting directly into the container in which your air plant is sitting greatly restricts the ability for excess water to evaporate and is there more likely to sit against the leaves allowing for fungus or bacteria to get to work and begin the irreversible rotting process.
            </p>
            <p>
              If keeping your air plant within a terrarium it is vital to make sure that the lid is always removed so that air can circulate properly and your poor little Tillandsia will not suffer! Remember, when keeping air plants at home this does not replicate the natural environment in which they evolved to thrive in, and as such, will require you to put certain measures in place to ensure they can still adapt to their new, unfamiliar environment. Don’t be put off though! It is actually very simple to do this. Like almost all plants, light and water are the predominant factors that influence how healthy, and thus how happy your Tillandsia will be. In the case of rotting - prevention is better than cure!

            <h3>ROTTING</h3>

            <hr />
            <p>
              Firstly it is worth knowing that this can occur in two different ways. You have dry rot and wet rot. Both are usually fatal for the air plant (we have experienced very, very few survivors of rot once it has started), and so worth knowing how to identify it as soon as it starts.
            </p>
            <p>
              Wet rot: Needless to say this is caused by overwatering, and typically affects the base of the plant first and foremost. It is indicated by a dulling of the base into a brownish / purplish colour, though sometimes this happens at the edges of the leaves which is easier to deal with than in the middle. If you see rot in the middle of the leaves at the base there is a strong chance that the rot has already worked its way into the core and it is only a matter of time before your beloved Tillandsia crumbles into pieces. It is heartbreaking to lose one like this, of course, but never forget to see a positive in this, as it is a learning experience. We would suggest dissecting the deceased plant and having a really close look inside as this will give you a much more rounded idea of when and where it might have started, as well as what caused it (especially if you have lots of neighbouring air plants on display that all seem to be strangely unaffected). This takes time, but unfortunately it is a necessary series of steps for all air plant collectors out there!
            </p>
            <p>
              Try reducing the watering time as this is likely the issue. In addition to this it is good practice to avoid completely submerging your plants for the entire soak each time. By placing them in the water upside down with the base exposed to the air above can also minimise the extent to which moisture is allowed to cause adverse affects.
            </p>
            <br />

            <h3>WHAT ELSE DO I NEED TO KNOW?</h3>

            <hr />
            <p>
              If you want to get into the nitty gritty bits about Tillandsia care there are a few additional things that are worth knowing if you want to give your air plant the best chance at success.
            </p><p>
              There are two main categories of Tillandsia - mesic and xeric. Knowing which type your Tillandsia is will help you take all the right steps in ensuring their survival.
            </p><p>
              Mesic: These are typically characterised by darker green leaves that are smooth and often lack in visible trichomes. Curly or cupped leaves are another common feature of mesic air plants. Generally this type of Tillandsia tend to require more watering in order to thrive.
            </p><p>
              Examples of mesic air plants include Tillandsia bulbosa, albertiana and brachycaulos abdita.
            </p><p>
              Xeric: This type of Tillandsia is characterised by more silvery coloured leaves and plenty of visible trichomes.  These air plants require less frequent watering and are more tolerant to sunlight than their mesic cousins. Examples include Tillandsia tectorum, xerographica and albida.
            </p><p>
              Many air plants fall somewhere in between these two categories in which case their light/watering requirements fall in between the two ends of the specrtrum outlined above.

              require a humid environment. Actually, the level of humidity required correlates with the level of sunlight
              recieved. South America gets more than its fair share of intense sunlight.
            </p> <p>
              If the environment you choose to keep your air plant provides a great deal of sunlight then you need to mist it with
              a spray more often. Daily if possible.

              This can often be the most difficult part to get right. You have the right environment, enough light, and your keeping
              your airplant hydrated with regular misting. But sometimes this isn't enough. Once every one or two weeks, you should
              soak your airplants.
            </p> <p>
              Soak your air plants in normal temparature tap water or natural water for up to ten minutes. Afterwards, shake off any excess
              water and place the plants on a towel.
            </p>
            <p>Air plants can rot if they do not dry out within 2 hours. Be careful to make sure this doesn't happen after a soak.</p>

              Brown or crispy leaves are a sign of underwatering.
            </p> <p>
              A darkened base and loss of leaves means your air plant is rotting. This is caused by overwatering.
            </p>
            <p> Extra-tip:  Airplants should be kept in an environmental temparature between 15 and 40 degreen Celsius.</p>
